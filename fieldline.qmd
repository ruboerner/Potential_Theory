We try to find an equation for the field lines of a dipole.

![A schematic sketch of a field line of a dipole aligned with the $z$-axis.](images/Feldlinie.excalidraw.svg){#fig-fieldline}

It holds for a field line that

$$
\mathbf{H} \times \mathrm{d} \mathbf{s} = \mathbf{0}
$$

which means that both the field vector and the line element are tangential at any point along the field line.

The equation for the magnetostatic field of a magnetic dipole aligned with the $z$-axis is given by

$$
\mathbf H(r, \theta) = 
\left( {H_r \atop H_\theta} \right) = 
\frac{m}{4 \pi r^3} 
\left(
{{2 \cos\theta} \atop {\sin\theta} }\right).
$$

In this case, the magnetic dipole moment is given by
$$
\mathbf{m} = (0, 0, m)^\top,
$$
and the tangential line element is
$$
\mathrm d \mathbf s = (\mathrm dr, r \, \mathrm d\theta, 0)^\top.
$$

Let's compute the cross product with the help of `SymPy`. 

```{python}
r, theta, d_r, d_theta, H_r, H_theta = symbols('r theta d_r d_theta H_r H_theta', real=True) 

H = Matrix([H_r, H_theta, 0])
ds = Matrix([d_r, r * d_theta, 0])
display(Math('\\mathbf H \\times \\mathrm d \\mathbf s = ' + latex(H.cross(ds)) + ' = \\mathbf 0'))
```

We arrive at
$$
H_r r \mathrm{d}\theta = H_\theta \mathrm{d} r.
$$
This is the differential equation of a field line. We need a parametric solution of the form $r = r(\theta)$.

We rearrange the ODE using the definition of $\mathbf H$ given above into the following form:
$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}r}{\mathrm{d}\theta} = 2 r \cot\theta
$$
To obtain a solution using `SymPy`, we recast `r` as a symbolic function (of $\theta$):

```{python}
#| tags: []
r = symbols("r", cls=Function)
R = dsolve(r(theta).diff(theta) - 2 * r(theta) * cot(theta), r(theta))

display(Math(latex(R)))
```

We choose $C_1=r_0$, where $r_0$ is an arbitrary scale length. The parametric equation for a field line of a dipole is finally given by
$$
r(\theta) = r_0 \sin^2 \theta
$$

## Visualization

We choose an arbitrary scale length $r_0$. Since $\theta$ is the pole distance angle, $\sin\theta=1$ at the equator, i.e., on the plane perpendicular to the dipole. Hence, $r_0$ can be interpreted as the distance to the field line at the equator, since $r(\theta) = r_0$ for $\theta=\pi/2$.

Note further, that we have to transform $r$ and $\theta$ into a Cartesian coordinate system using the relations
$$
\begin{align}
x & = r(\theta) \cos\phi \\
z & = r(\theta) \sin\phi
\end{align}
$$
where $\phi = \pi/2 - \theta$.

```{python}
#| tags: []
n = 100
theta_n = np.linspace(start=0, stop=np.pi, num=n)
r_0 = 1.0
x = []
z = []
for t in theta_n:
    x.append(r_0 * np.sin(t)**2 * np.cos(np.pi/2 - t))
    z.append(r_0 * np.sin(t)**2 * np.sin(np.pi/2 - t))
```

```{python}
#| tags: []
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6,4))
plt.plot(x, z, marker='.', markersize=2, linewidth=0.5)
circle = mpatches.Circle((0,0), radius=0.1, alpha=0.5, fill=True)
ax.add_patch(circle)
ax.set_xlabel(r'x/r$_0$')
ax.set_ylabel(r'z/r$_0$')
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
ax.set_aspect('equal', 'box')
```

We observe that the shape of the field line is invariant with respect to the ratio $r/r_0$.

In planetary geophysics, the _L-shell_ or _L-value_ is a particular set of magnetic field lines.
The L-value describes the field lines which cross the Earth's magnetic equator at a number of Earth radii equal to the L-value.

L-shells uniquely define regions of particular geophysical interest. 
For instance, auroral light displays are most common around $L=6$, can reach $L=4$ and even $L=2$ during most severe geomagnetic storms.

## Properties of field lines derived from differential geometry

Two questions are of particular interest:

1. What is the _curvature radius_ of the field line in the equatorial plane?
2. At which angle $\theta$ the tangential line is horizontal?

### Curvature
For the curvature $\kappa(\theta)$ of a parametric curve defined in polar coordinates $r$ and $\theta$ in the point $r(\theta)$ there holds ([cf. this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvature))

$$
\kappa(\theta) = \frac{r(\theta)^2 + 2 r'(\theta)^2 - r(\theta) r''(\theta)}
{\left[r(\theta)^2 + r'(\theta)^2\right]^{3/2}}
$$

We implement this equation to obtain the curvature radius in the equatorial plane where $\theta=\pi/2$.

First, we introduce a symbolic function `R` which defines $r(\theta) = \sin^2\theta$.
Next, we implement the curvature function $\kappa(\theta)$ using `SymPy`.
Finally, in $\kappa$ we substitute $\theta$ by $\pi/2$.

```{python}
#| tags: []
R = sin(theta)**2
kappa = (R**2 + 2 * diff(R, theta)**2 - R * diff(R, theta, theta)) / (
        sqrt(R**2 + diff(R, theta)**2)**3)
```

```{python}
#| tags: []
display(Math('\\kappa = ' + latex(kappa.subs(theta, pi/2))))
```

The curvature evaluates to $\kappa=3$.

We note that the _curvature radius_ is the inverse of the curvature.
Hence, when $r_0 = 1$, the curvature radius at the equator is $r_\kappa = 1/3$.

Let's check this:

The origin of a circle with curvature radius of $r_\kappa=1/3$ is at the point $(2/3, 0)$.
We expect that the shape of this circle approximates the field line near the equatorial plane.

```{python}
#| tags: []
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6,4))
plt.plot(x, z, marker='.', markersize=2, linewidth=0.5)
circle = mpatches.Circle((0,0), radius=0.1, alpha=0.1, fill=True)
check = mpatches.Circle((2/3,0), radius=1/3, color='green', alpha=0.5, fill=True)
plt.plot([2/3], [0], 'o', color='black', markersize=1)
ax.add_patch(circle)
ax.add_patch(check)
ax.set_xlabel(r'x/r$_0$')
ax.set_ylabel(r'z/r$_0$')
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
ax.set_aspect('equal', 'box')
```

### Horizontal slope

To find the angle where the slope of the field line is horizontal, we have to form the _parametric derivative_ of the function in the $x-z$-plane.

Let $x(\theta)$ and $z(\theta)$ be the coordinates of the points of the curve expressed as functions of a variable $\theta$, i.e.,

$$
z = z(\theta), \qquad x = x(\theta). 
$$

Then the first derivative implied by these parametric equations is easily derived using the _chain rule_ as

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}x} = \frac{\mathrm{d}z / \mathrm{d \theta}}{\mathrm{d}x / \mathrm{d \theta}} = \frac{z'(\theta)}{x'(\theta)}
$$

where the notation $x'(\theta)$ denotes the derivative of $x$ with respect to $\theta$.

To find the point where the slope of the field line is horizontal, the derivative of $z$ with respect to $x$ must be zero (necessary condition). i.e.,

$$
\frac{z'(\theta)}{x'(\theta)} = 0.
$$

We search all angles $\theta$ for which this condition is fulfilled. 

```{python}
#| tags: []
X = R * cos(pi/2 - theta)
Z = R * sin(pi/2 - theta)
theta_star = np.take(solve(Z.diff(theta) / X.diff(theta)), [1, 3])
angles = np.array([90 - p.evalf() * 180 / np.pi for p in theta_star])
angles = angles.astype('float')
print('The two angles are at ', angles, ' degrees.')
```

As seen from the dipole position, the field lines are horizontal at an angle of approx. $\pm 35\textdegree$ below and above the equatorial plane.

```{python}
#| tags: []
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6,4))
plt.plot(x, z, marker='.', markersize=2, linewidth=0.5)
circle = mpatches.Circle((0,0), radius=0.1, alpha=0.1, fill=True)
check = mpatches.Circle((2/3,0), radius=1/3, color='green', alpha=0.1, fill=True)
check_slope = mpatches.Wedge((0,0), r=2/3, theta1=360.0+angles[1], theta2=angles[0], color='red', alpha=0.5)
ax.add_patch(circle)
ax.add_patch(check)
ax.add_patch(check_slope)
ax.set_xlabel(r'x/r$_0$')
ax.set_ylabel(r'z/r$_0$')
ax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
ax.set_aspect('equal', 'box')
```

The distance from the dipole to the points where the slope is horizontal is $r^* = r_0 \sin^2 \theta^*$.

It is always $\frac{2}{3}r_0$.
