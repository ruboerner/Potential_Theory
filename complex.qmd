## 2-D Problems in Potential Theory Solved Using Complex Analysis

2-D problems in potential theory can be elegantly solved using _complex analysis_, the theory of differentiable complex-valued functions of complex variables.

The following _tools_ from mathematics are used:

- Cauchy's Integral Theorem
- Cauchy's Integral Formula
- Cauchy-Riemann Differential Equations
- Residue Theorem of Complex Analysis

## Space of Complex Numbers $\mathbb{C}$
$\mathbb{C}$ is a two-dimensional real vector space with the canonical basis $(1, i)$. A point $z \in \mathbb{C}$ has real Cartesian coordinates $x := \mathrm{Re}(z)$, $y := \mathrm{Im}(z) \in \mathbb{R}$, briefly expressed as $z = x + i y$.

A complex-valued function $f: U \subset \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ on an open subset of $\mathbb{C}$ can therefore be expressed by decomposing it into its real and imaginary parts $f(x + i y) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y)$, viewed as an $\mathbb{R}^2$-valued function of two real variables $(x, y) \in \tilde{U} := \{(a, b) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \ | \ a + i b \in U\}$.

## Cauchy's Integral Theorem
In real analysis, the value of an integral depends on the _integration bounds_. For complex functions, the _path_ also matters.

Let $U \subset \mathbb{C}$ be a simply connected (no holes) open domain (_elementary domain_), and $f: U \mapsto \mathbb{C}$ a holomorphic function. Furthermore, let $\gamma : [a, b] \to U$ be a smooth, closed curve. Then:
$$
\oint_{\gamma} f(z) \, \mathrm{d}z = 0.
$$

::: {.callout-note}

A __holomorphic function__ is a complex-valued function
$f:\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$
that is complex differentiable at every point of an open set in the complex plane.

The key property is complex differentiability in the sense of the limit
$$
f’(z_0)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(z_0+h)-f(z_0)}{h}
$$
existing for all complex directions of $h$. This requirement is far stronger than real differentiability and leads to remarkable consequences.

Holomorphic functions preserve angles and local geometric structure in the following precise sense:

__Conformal behaviour__

Let
$$f:\Omega\subset\mathbb C\to\mathbb C$$
be holomorphic with a non-vanishing derivative $f’(z_0)\neq 0$.
Then, in a neighbourhood of $z_0$, the mapping acts like a complex linear map
$$
w = f(z) \approx f(z_0) + f’(z_0)(z - z_0).
$$

This map consists of two elementary operations:

1.	Rotation:
Multiplication by $e^{i\theta}$ rotates all small line segments by the same angle $\theta$.
2.	Uniform scaling:
Multiplication by $|a|$ stretches or shrinks all small line segments by the same factor.

There is no shearing, no anisotropic distortion, and no reflection.

__Angle preservation__

Suppose two smooth curves meet at $z_0$ under an angle $\alpha$.
Under $f$, the corresponding tangent vectors are multiplied by the same complex number $f’(z_0)$, which rotates and scales them uniformly. Therefore, the angle between the curves is unchanged.

Formally, if $v_1$ and $v_2$ are tangent directions at $z_0$, then
$$
\arg\!\left(\frac{f’(z_0)v_2}{f’(z_0)v_1}\right)
=\arg\!\left(\frac{v_2}{v_1}\right),
$$
so the orientation of the angle is preserved.

__Preservation of local structure__

A holomorphic function with $f’(z_0)\neq 0$ maps a sufficiently small neighbourhood of $z_0$ onto a small neighbourhood of $f(z_0)$ in a way that is locally similar:
shapes become rotated and uniformly scaled copies of themselves. Circles become circles, small grids become locally rotated/scaled grids, and the mapping remains injective in a small neighbourhood.

This behaviour is what is meant by saying that holomorphic functions are conformal at points where their derivative is non-zero.

**Proof:** With $f = u + i v$ and $\mathrm{d}z = \mathrm{d}x + i \mathrm{d}y$, it follows:
$$
\oint_{\gamma} f(z) \, \mathrm{d}z = 
\oint_{\gamma} (u + i v) (\mathrm{d}x + i \mathrm{d}y) =
\oint_{\gamma} (u \mathrm{d}x - v \mathrm{d}y) +
i \oint_{\gamma} (v \mathrm{d}x + u \mathrm{d}y).
$$
Using Green's Theorem:
$$
\iint_D \left(\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}(x,y) - \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y)\right)\, \mathrm{d}x \, \mathrm{d}y  = \oint_{C} \left(f(x,y)\, \mathrm{d}x + g(x,y)\, \mathrm{d}y\right),
$$
the line integrals are replaced by surface integrals over the region $D$ enclosed by the curve $\gamma$:
$$
\begin{align}
\oint_\gamma (u \, \mathrm{d}x - v \, \mathrm{d}y) & = \iint_D \left( -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right) \, \mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y, \\
\oint_\gamma (v \, \mathrm{d}x + u \, \mathrm{d}y) & = \iint_D \left(  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \right) \, \mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y.
\end{align}
$$
For the real and imaginary parts $u$ and $v$ of holomorphic functions in the domain $D$, the __Cauchy-Riemann differential equations__ hold:
$$
\begin{align}
u_x & = +v_y, \\
u_y & = -v_x.
\end{align}
$$
Thus, both integrands---and consequently the integral---are zero:
$$
\iint_D \left( -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right) \, \mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y = \iint_D \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} -\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right) \, \mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y = 0,
$$
and
$$
\iint_D \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \right) \, \mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y = 
\iint_D \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right) \, \mathrm{d}x\,\mathrm{d}y = 0.
$$
Hence:
$$
\oint_{\gamma} f(z) \, \mathrm{d}z = 0 \qquad \square
$$

## Cauchy's Integral Formula (CIF)

The __Cauchy integral formula__ is one of the central results of complex analysis. It expresses the value of a holomorphic function inside a closed curve __entirely in terms of its boundary values__.

Let $U$ be an open subset of the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$. Consider the closed disk $D$ fully contained within $U$, defined as:
$$
D = \{ z : |z - z_{0}| \le r \}.
$$
Let $f: U \mapsto \mathbb{C}$ be a holomorphic function, and $\gamma$ a counterclockwise-oriented circle along the boundary of $D$. Then, for any point $a$ inside $D$:
$$
f(a) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{\gamma} \frac{f(z)}{z - a} \, \mathrm{d}z.
$$
The _CIF_ states that the values of a holomorphic function $f$ inside a disk are fully determined by its values on the boundary of that disk.



## Residue Theorem
If $f(z)$ is holomorphic in the neighborhood of a point $z_{0}$, then:
$$
\oint_{C} f(z) \, \mathrm{d}z = 0.
$$
However, if $f(z)$ has an isolated singularity at $z_{0}$, the integral is generally nonzero and satisfies:
$$
\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint_{C} f(z) \, \mathrm{d}z = \mathrm{Res} f(z).
$$
For a simple pole:
$$
\mathrm{Res} f(z) = \lim_{ z \to z_{0} } (z - z_{0}) f(z).
$$
Instead of computing contour integrals, one only needs to calculate residues, which is often simpler.
