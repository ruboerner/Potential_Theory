# Lecture Notes on Theory of Potential Field Methods in Geophysics

![](images/3dearth.png)

This repository contains the `Quarto` source code of my 2025/26 lecture notes on "Theory of Potential Field Methods" for geophysicists enrolled at [Technische Universit√§t Bergakademie Freiberg](https://www.tu-freiberg.de/geophysik).

The course is tailored for Master's students of Geophysics and Geoinformatics.

The notes are still WIP and are being updated frequently.
