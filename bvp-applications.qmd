## Method of mirrors

We consider the second BVP (Neumann problem) for the half-space.
Because of $\sigma_{air} \approx 0$ we set at $z=0$ (Air-Earth interface)
$$
 \frac{\partial U}{\partial n} = 0
$$
A point electrode carrying a current of $I$ located at the point $\vb{r_{0}}=(x_{0}, y_{0}, 0)^\top$ causes a potential at point $\vb{r}$
$$
U(\vb{r}) = \frac{\rho I}{2 \pi |\vb{r} - \vb{r_{0}} |}
$$
where $\rho$ is the resistivity of the homogeneous half-space.


When the current electrode is at a depth $t$ inside the half-space, i.e., at the point $\vb{r_{1}} = (x_{0}, y_{0}, t)^\top, t > 0$, we can calculate the potential by means of the method of mirrors.

In $z=0$ we observe
$$
\vb{e}_{z} \cdot \vb{E} = -\vb{e}_{z} \cdot \nabla U = - \frac{\partial U}{\partial z} = 0 
$$


We can construct an auxiliary Green's function that generates the desired behavior in $z=0$ by introducing a mirror source at $\vb{r_{2}} = (x_{0}, y_{0}, -t)^\top$. 
We follow these steps:

- mirror the source in $z=t < 0$ at plane $z=0$
- resulting in mirror source at $z=-t$
- replace the resistivity of the insulating half-space by the resistivity of the lower half-space
- inject the same current $I$ at both (real and mirrored) sources
- observe no-flow through $z=0$

The potential function
$$
U(\vb{r}) = \frac{\rho I}{4 \pi} \left( \frac{1}{|\vb{r}-\vb{r_{1}} |}+\frac{1}{|\vb{r}-\vb{r_{2}} |} \right) 
$$
satisfies the Neumann condition in $z=0$ as well as $\nabla^{2}U=0$, Further, $U(\vb{r}) \to 0$ for $| \vb{r}| \to \infty$.

**Question:** May we apply the method of mirrors when the upper half-space is a conductor?

![](images/RWA-two-halfspaces.excalidraw.svg)


When observing the potential in the lower half-space $z>0$, we introduce a fictitious current source with current $I'$ at $z=-t$. We observe a superposition of both sources in $z>0$:
$$
U_{1}(P_{1}) = \frac{\rho_{1}I}{4 \pi |\vb{r} - \vb{r}_{1}|} + \frac{\rho I'}{4 \pi |\vb{r} - \vb{r}_{2}|}
$$
with
$$
\begin{align}
R_{1} & = |\vb{r} - \vb{r}_{1}| = \sqrt{ (x - x_{1})^{2} + (y - y_{1})^{2} + (z - t)^{2}} \\
R_{2} & = |\vb{r} - \vb{r}_{2}| = \sqrt{ (x - x_{2})^{2} + (y - y_{2})^{2} + (z + t)^{2}} 
\end{align}
$$


When the point of observation is in the upper half-space, we introduce another fictitious source with strength $I''$ at $z=t$ and obtain
$$
U_{2}(P_{2}) = \frac{\rho_{2}I''}{4 \pi |\vb{r} - \vb{r}_{3}|}
$$
The two currents $I'$ and $I''$ are still unknown.
We need the conditions of contnuity in $z=0$ to determine these two currents.


In $z=0$ there holds
$$
\begin{align}
U_{1} & = U_{2} \\
\sigma_{1} \frac{ \partial U_{1} }{ \partial z }  & = \sigma_{2} \frac{ \partial U_{2} }{ \partial z } 
\end{align}
$$
If we move the observation point into the plane $z=0$, then $R_{1} = R_{2} = R_{3}$. It follows
$$
\rho_{1}I' - \rho_{2}I'' = -\rho_{1}I
$$
From the second condition we obtain
$$
I' + I'' = I
$$


Finally, we get
$$
\begin{align}
I' & = \frac{\rho_{2}-\rho_{1}}{\rho_{1}+\rho_{2}}I = k_{12}I \\
I'' & = \frac{2\rho_{1}}{\rho_{1}+\rho_{2}}I = t_{12}I
\end{align}
$$
The coefficients $k_{12}$ and $t_{12}$ are referred to as _coefficient of reflection_ and _coefficient of transmission_, resp.
It holds
$$
t_{12} = 1 - k_{12}, \quad -1 \le k_{12} \le 1
$$
If the upper half-space is an ideal conductor, i.e., $\rho_{2}=0$, then $k_{12}=-1$. When $\rho_{2} \to \infty$, then $k_{12}=1$.


We conclude that
$$
\begin{align}
U_{1} & = \frac{\rho_{1}I}{4 \pi} \left( \frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{k_{12}}{R_{2}} \right)  \\
U_{2} & = \frac{\rho_{2}I}{4 \pi R_{3}} \frac{2 \rho_{1}}{\rho_{1}+\rho_{2}} = \frac{\rho_{m}I}{4 \pi R_{3}}
\end{align}
$$
with
$$
\rho_{m} = \frac{2 \rho_{1} \rho_{2}}{\rho_{1} + \rho_{2}} = \left[ \frac{\sigma_{1}+\sigma_{2}}{2}  \right] ^{-1}
$$
The potential in the upper half-space is that of a homogeneous full-space with a resistivity $\rho_{m}$.

## A conducting semi-sphere as an electrode

We consider a uniform halfspace with resistivity $\rho_2$. There is a point source $I$ located at the origin. The semi-sphere of radius $a$ has a resistivity of $\rho_1$. The semi-sphere is aligned with the $z$-axis.
The upper half-space is insulating, we impose a Neumann boundary condition in $z=0$.

**Goal**: Find the potential inside and outside of the semi-sphere.

![](images/RWA-semisphere.excalidraw.svg){width=40%}

We make the ansatz:

$$
\begin{align}
U_1(r) &= \frac{\rho_1 I}{2 \pi r} + U_{0} \qquad & r < a \\
U_2(r) &= \frac{\rho_2 I'}{2 \pi r} \qquad & r > a
\end{align}
$$

**Q:** What's the rationale behind this ansatz?

To solve for the unknowns $U_{0}$ and $I'$ we need the conditions of continuity at the surface of the semisphere, where $r=a$:

$$
\begin{align}
U_1 & = U_2 \\
\frac{1}{\rho_1} \partial_r U_1 & = \frac{1}{\rho_2} \partial_r U_2
\end{align}
$$


We first carry out the differentiation and then replace $r$ with $a$ to find
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\rho_{1}I}{2 \pi a} + U_{0} & = \frac{\rho_{2}I'}{2 \pi a} \\
-\frac{I}{2 \pi a^{2}} & = -\frac{I'}{2 \pi a^{2}}
\end{align}
$$
which simplifies to
$$
I' = I
$$
and
$$
U_{0} = \frac{(\rho_{2}-\rho_{1})I}{2 \pi a}
$$


### Summary of the result

$$
\begin{align}
U_{1}(r)  & = \frac{\rho_{1}I}{2 \pi r} + \frac{(\rho_{2}-\rho_{1})I}{2 \pi a} \\
U_{2}(r) & = \frac{\rho_{2}I}{2 \pi r}
\end{align}
$$

### Explanation

The potential inside the semi-sphere is composed of two contributions:

- the potential due to the point source
- the potential caused by charge accumulation across the surface of the semi-sphere

The latter is constant.


### Visualization

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

rho1 = 1.0
rho2 = 100.0
a = 1.0
def U1(r):
    u = rho1 / (2 * np.pi * r) + (rho2 - rho1) / (2 * np.pi * a)
    return u

def U2(r):
    u = rho2 / ( 2 * np.pi * r)
    return u
R1 = np.linspace(start=0.1, stop=a, num=41)
R2 = np.linspace(start=a, stop=10.0, num=41)

plt.plot(R1, [U1(r) for r in R1])
plt.plot(R2, [U2(r) for r in R2])
plt.grid(True)
plt.title('Potential')
plt.xlabel('r in m');
```

We observe that the potential is continuous in $r=a$.


```{python}
plt.plot(R1, [1 / (2 * np.pi * r**2) for r in R1])
plt.plot(R2, [1 / (2 * np.pi * r**2) for r in R2])
plt.grid(True)
plt.title('Current density')
plt.xlabel('r in m');
```


```{python}
plt.plot(R1, [rho1 / (2 * np.pi * r**2) for r in R1])
plt.plot(R2, [rho2 / (2 * np.pi * r**2) for r in R2])
plt.grid(True)
plt.title('Electric field')
plt.xlabel('r in m');
```

The field only has a normal component w.r.t. the surface of the semi-sphere. 
Therefore, we observe a discontinuity in the order of the jump in resistivities.

## The two-layer case

We consider the case when the half-space is composed of two layers with distinct resistivities $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$. The thickness of layer 1 is $h$. 


![](images/RWA-twolayer.excalidraw.svg)


We calculate the potential $V$ at the surface of the half-space.



Let's first assume that $h \to \infty$. Then the potential in the top-layer is that of a homogeneous half-space

$$
V(r) = \frac{\rho_{1} I}{2 \pi r}
$$

However, when the thickness of the top-layer is finite, we observe a superposition of the potential of a homogeneous half-space and a potential caused by the basement layer.

![](images/Zweischichtfall_Skizze.excalidraw.svg){width="80%"}


We introduce a mirror source at $z=2h$ and get

$$
V'(r) = \frac{I \rho_{1}}{2 \pi} \left( \frac{1}{r} + \frac{k_{12}}{r_{1}}\right) 
$$

with

$$
k_{12} = \frac{\rho_{2} - \rho_{1}}{\rho_{2} + \rho_{1}}
$$
 

The mirror source is not consistent with the Neumann boundary condition at $z=0$.

We introduce a further mirror at $z=-2h$ and obtain

$$
V'' = \frac{I \rho_{1}}{2 \pi} \left( \frac{k_{12} \cdot k_{10}}{r_{1}} \right) \approx \frac{I \rho_{1}}{2 \pi} \frac{k_{12}}{r_{1}}
$$

with

$$
k_{10} = \frac{\rho_{0} - \rho_{1}}{\rho_{0} + \rho_{1}} \approx 1
$$



$$
V' + V'' = \frac{I \rho_{1}}{2 \pi} \left( \frac{1}{r} + \frac{2 k_{12}}{r_{1}} \right) 
$$

$$
V''' = \frac{I \rho_{1}}{2 \pi} \left( \frac{k_{12} \cdot k_{12}}{r_{2}} \right) 
$$

with

$$
\begin{align}
r_{1} & = \sqrt{ r^{2} + (2z)^{2} } \\
r_{2} & = \sqrt{ r^{2} + (4z)^{2} } \\
r_{m} & = \sqrt{ r^{2} + (2mz)^{2} }
\end{align}
$$

The mirror at $z=-4h$ results in

$$
V''' + V^{(4)} = \frac{I \rho_{1}}{2 \pi} \left( \frac{k_{12} \cdot k_{12}}{r_{2}} + \frac{k_{12} \cdot k_{12} \cdot k_{10}}{r_{2}} \right) \approx \frac{I \rho_{1}}{2 \pi} \left( \frac{2k_{12}^{2}}{r_{2}} \right)
$$

The resulting potential is

$$
V = \frac{I \rho_{1}}{2 \pi} \left( \frac{1}{r} + \frac{2k_{12}}{r_{1}} + \frac{2 k_{12}^{2}}{r_{2}} + \dots + \frac{2 k_{12}^{m}}{r_{m}} + \dots \right) 
$$

or in compact form

$$
V = \frac{I \rho_{1}}{2 \pi} \left( \frac{1}{r} + 2 \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \frac{k_{12}^{m}}{\sqrt{ r^{2} + (2 m z)^{2} }} \right) 
$$

The first term represents the normal potemtial, while the summation provides the effect of the anomalous potential caused by the finite thickness $h$.

The series converges because $|k_{12}|<1$.

Further, the denominator increases with increasing $m$.

**Numerical implementation:** The amount of terms in the summation depends on $k_{12}$ and $z/r$.

## Resistivity sounding over an $N$-layered half-space

We consider the $N$-layered case for DC resistivity applications.

For the solution of the problem, the method of mirrors seems tedious due to the vast amount of mirror sources to be considered.

A more practical method is based on the solution of the Laplace equation in an appropriate coordinate system. We choose a cylindrical coordinate system.

![](images/RWA-N-layered.excalidraw.svg)

In cylindrical coordinates with axial symmetry, the Laplace equation reads
$$
\Delta U = \frac{1}{r} \frac{ \partial U }{ \partial r } \left(r \frac{ \partial U }{ \partial r }\right) + \frac{ \partial^{2} U }{ \partial z^{2} } = 0
$$
We choose the method of _separation of variables_:
$$
U(r,z) = F(r, \lambda) \cdot Z(z, \lambda)
$$
and enforce 
$$
U \to 0 \text{ for } R \to \infty 
$$
where $R^{2} = r^{2} + z^{2}$.

Inserting into the Laplace equation yields
$$
\underbrace{ \frac{1}{rF} \frac{ \mathrm d }{ \mathrm dr }  \left( r \frac{ \mathrm dF }{ \mathrm dr }   \right) }_{ =-\lambda^{2} } + \underbrace{ \frac{1}{Z}  \frac{ \mathrm d^{2} Z }{ \mathrm dz^{2} } }_{ =+\lambda^{2} } = 0
$${#eq-laplace-sep}

with the _separation parameter_ $\lambda$. The first term is
$$
F'' + \frac{1}{r} F' + \lambda^{2} F = 0
$$
which is referred to as _Bessel differential equation_, which has the solution
$$
F(r, \lambda) = C(\lambda)J_{0}(\lambda r) + D(\lambda)N_{0}(\lambda r)
$$
Since $N_{0}(\lambda r)$ has a singularity at $r=0$, we discard it by setting $D(\lambda)=0$ for all $\lambda$.

The second term in @eq-laplace-sep describes an exponential decay:
$$
Z'' - \lambda^{2}Z = 0
$$
Its solution is
$$
Z(z, \lambda) = A(\lambda) e^{ -\lambda z } + B(\lambda) e^{ +\lambda z }
$$
Finally,
$$
U_{i}(r,z) = \frac{\rho_{1}I}{2 \pi } \int_{0}^{\infty} \left( A_{i} e^{ -\lambda z } + B_{i}e^{ +\lambda z } \right) J_{0}(\lambda r) \, \dd \lambda
$$
This is the _secondary potential function_ of layer $i$ which is caused by the layered half-space and adds to the _primary potential_ $U_{0}(r,z)$ of a homogeneous half-space of resistivity $\rho_{1}$.



For $U_{0}$ it holds
$$
\begin{align}
U_{0}(r,z) & = \frac{\rho_{1}I}{2 \pi R} = \frac{\rho_{1}I}{2 \pi} \frac{1}{\sqrt{ r^{2}+z^{2} }} \\
 & = \frac{\rho_{1}I}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{ -\lambda z } J_{0}(\lambda r) \, \dd \lambda 
\end{align}
$$
The integral is the well-known _Weber-Lipschitz integral_.

For $n=1$ we find for the total potential
$$
U_{1}(r,z) = U_{0}(r,z) + \frac{\rho_{1}I}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} \left[ A_{1}(\lambda)e^{ -\lambda z } + B_{1}(\lambda)e^{ +\lambda z }) \right] J_{0}(\lambda r) \, \dd \lambda 
$$
Inside the basement layer with index $i=n$ it holds for the secondary potential
$$
U_{n}(r,z) = \frac{\rho_{1}I}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} A_{n}(\lambda)e^{ -\lambda z } J_{0}(\lambda r)\, \dd \lambda 
$$
Here we restrict the solution such that
$$
U_{n} \to 0 \text{ for } (r,z) \to \infty
$$
which holds for $B_{n}(\lambda)=0$.

It remains to determine the $2n-1$ unknowns $A_{1}, B_{1}, \dots, A_{n}$.

At the layer boundaries $z=z_{i}, i=1,2,\dots,n-1$ we apply the usual conditions of continuity for the potential and the vertical component of the current density. 
These $2n-2$ conditions have to be completed with the condition
$$
\frac{ \partial U_{1} }{ \partial z } = 0 \text{ in } z=0
$$
from which we obtain from the secondary potential
$$
A_{1}(\lambda) = B_{1}(\lambda)
$$

We consider now the case $n=2$. The layer boundary is in $z=h$.

The potential in the first layer is
$$
U_{1}(r,z) = \frac{\rho_{1}I}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} \left[ (1 + A_{1}(\lambda))e^{ -\lambda z } + A_{1}(\lambda)e^{ +\lambda z }) \right] J_{0}(\lambda r) \, \dd \lambda 
$$
For the second layer we obtain
$$
U_{2}(r,z) = \frac{\rho_{1}I}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} A_{2}(\lambda)e^{ -\lambda z } J_{0}(\lambda r)\, \dd \lambda 
$$

The conditions in $z=h$ are
$$
\begin{align}
U_{1} & = U_{2} \\
\frac{1}{\rho_{1}} \frac{ \partial U_{1} }{ \partial z }  & = \frac{1}{\rho_{2}} \frac{ \partial U_{2} }{ \partial z }
\end{align}
$$
from which we obtain
$$
A_{1}(\lambda) = k_{12} \frac{e^{ -2 h \lambda }}{1 - k_{12}e^{ -2 h \lambda }}
$$
and
$$
A_{2}(\lambda) = t_{12} \frac{1}{1 - k_{12}e^{ -2 h \lambda }}
$$
where
$$
k_{12} = \frac{\rho_{2}-\rho_{1}}{\rho_{2}+\rho_{1}}
$$
and
$$
t_{12} = \frac{2 \rho_{2}}{\rho_{1}+\rho_{2}}
$$
For $z=0$ we find
$$
\begin{align}
U_{1}(r,0)  & = \frac{\rho_{1}I}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} \left( 1 + 2 A_{1}(\lambda) \right) J_{0}(\lambda r)  \, \dd \lambda   \\
 & = \frac{\rho_{1}I}{2 \pi} \left\{ \frac{1}{r} +  2\int_{0}^{\infty} A_{1}(\lambda)  J_{0}(\lambda r)  \, \dd \lambda\right\} 
\end{align}
$$
The integral is known as _Stefanescu integral_.
The kernel function
$$
A_{1} = A_{1}(\lambda, \rho_{1}, \rho_{2}, h)
$$
contains all information about the subsurface.

Recall that $|k_{12}| < 1$.
With
$$
x:= k_{12}e^{ -2 h \lambda }
$$
we can rewrite the kernel function as
$$
A_{1} = \frac{x}{1-x}
$$
For small $x$ we expand this into a series
$$
\frac{x}{1-x} \approx x + x^{2} + x^{3} \dots = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty}x^{m} \quad\text{ for } |x|<1
$$
We recognize
$$
A_{1} = \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \left( k_{12}e^{ -2 h \lambda } \right) ^{m}
$$
For $U_{1}$ we obtain
$$
U_{1}(r,z) = \frac{\rho_{1}I}{2 \pi} \left\{ \frac{1}{r} + 2 \int_{0}^{\infty} J_{0}(\lambda r) \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \left( k_{12}e^{ -2 h \lambda } \right) ^{m} \, \dd \lambda  \right\} 
$$
From the Weber-Lipschitz integral we know that, with $z=2 h m$,
$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{ r^{2} + 4 h^{2} m^{2}}} = \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{ -2 h m \lambda } J_{0}(\lambda r) \, \dd \lambda 
$$
It follows after rearranging the order of integration and summation, that
$$
U_{1}(r,z) = \frac{\rho_{1}I}{2 \pi} \left\{ \frac{1}{r} + 2 \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} \frac{k_{12}^{m}}{\sqrt{ r^{2}+4 m^{2}h^{2} }} \right\} 
$$

This reproduces the result obtained formerly with the help of the method of mirrors for the two-layered case.

For $n>2$ we can exploit a recursion algorithm.
We define
$$
T_{1} = \rho_{1}(1+2A_{1})
$$
with
$$
\begin{align}
T_{n} & = \rho_{n} \\
T_{i} & = \frac{T_{i+1} + \rho_{i}\tanh(\lambda d_{i})}{1 + \sigma_{i}T_{i+1}\tanh(\lambda d_{i})} \\
d_{i} & = z_{i} - z_{i-1}
\end{align}
$$
It follows
$$
U_{1}(r,0) = \frac{I}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} T_{1}(\lambda) J_{0}(\lambda r)\, \dd \lambda 
$${#eq-pot-u1}

### Apparent resistivity

In the Schlumberger array we have
$$
\rho_{a} = -\frac{2\pi r^{2}}{I} \frac{ \mathrm dU }{ \mathrm dr } \bigg|_{r=s}
$${#eq-rhoa}

where $s = \dfrac{L}{2}$ is the half electrode spacing.
Obtaining the gradient from @eq-pot-u1 and substituting in @eq-rhoa we have
$$
\rho_{a} = s^{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} T_{1}J_{1}(\lambda s) \lambda \, \dd \lambda 
$$

This integral can be evaluated after applying a transformation of the variables
$$
\begin{align}
r & = r_{0}e^{ x } \\
\lambda r_{0} & = e^{ -y } \\
\lambda r  & = e^{ x-y }
\end{align}
$$
which yields a _convolutional integral_
$$
\rho_{a}(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{T}(y) \hat{J}(x-y) \, \dd y 
$$
The numerical quadrature can be evaluated by a truncated sum
$$
\rho_{a,k} = \sum_{i=-n_{1}}^{n_{2}} a_{i}T_{k-i}
$$
where the $a_{i}$ are pre-calculated filter coefficients approximating the action of $\hat{J}$ on $\hat{T}$.
