Spherical harmonic analysis is a mathematical method used extensively in geophysics to represent functions (based on observations) on the surface of a sphere.
This technique is particularly useful for modeling the global geomagnetic field, which is inherently complex and varies both spatially and temporally.

In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:

- Legendre polynomials
- Solution of the Laplace equation in spherical coordinates
- Associated Legendre polynomials
- Schmidt quasi-normalized Legendre polynomials

Further, we emphasize the value of spherical harmonics in the mathematical description of the global magnetic field of the Earth.

## Basics of Spherical Harmonics

Spherical harmonics are a set of orthogonal functions defined on the surface of a sphere. They are the spherical analogues of the Fourier series used in periodic functions. A spherical harmonic function$Y_{n}^{m}(\theta, \phi) \in \mathbb C$ is defined by:

$$
Y_{n}^{m}(\theta, \phi) = \sqrt{\frac{(2n+1)(n-m)!}{4\pi(n+m)!}} P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta) e^{im\phi}
$$

where:

- $n$ is the degree,
- $m$ is the order,
- $0 \le \theta \le \pi$ is the colatitude,
- $0 \le \phi \le 2 \pi$ is the longitude,
- $P_{n}^{m}(\cos\theta)$ are the _associated Legendre polynomials_.

### Application to the Global Geomagnetic Field

The Earth's magnetic field can be expressed as a potential field, which is the gradient of a scalar potential $V$. This potential can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics:

$$
V(r, \theta, \phi) = a \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{a}{r} \right)^{n+1} \sum_{m=0}^{n} \left( g_{n}^{m} \cos m\phi + h_{n}^{m} \sin m\phi \right) P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta)
$$

where:

- $a$ is the Earth's mean radius,
- $r$ is the radial distance from the Earth's center,
- $g_{n}^{m}$ and $h_{n}^{m}$ are the Gauss coefficients, which are determined from observations.


### Importance in Geophysics

- **Global Representation**: Spherical harmonics provide a global representation of the geomagnetic field, allowing for the analysis of its spatial variations.
- **Data Fitting**: By fitting observational data to a spherical harmonic model, geophysicists can infer the distribution of magnetic sources within the Earth.
- **Temporal Changes**: The coefficients $g_{n}^{m}$ and $h_{n}^{m}$ can be monitored over time to study secular variation, which is the slow change in the Earth's magnetic field.

### Challenges and Considerations

- **Resolution**: The degree $n$ determines the resolution of the model; higher degrees provide more detail but require more data and computational power.
- **Data Quality**: Accurate spherical harmonic models depend on high-quality, globally distributed magnetic field measurements.

## Example

The following figures illustrate the Earth's total magnetic field (in nT) computed from the 15th generation of the _International Geomagnetic Reference Field_ (IGRF) model. From left to right, the spherical harmonic degree $n$ increases from 1 to 6 and then to 13.

For $n=1$, the field exhibits a dipolar structure whose dipole axis is inclined relative to the Earth’s rotation axis.
For degrees greater than 1, higher-order multipole contributions are present.
